emacs is a lovely piece of program that'll let us make files with multiple lines, and edit them, easily, via this tasty text editor.
I this magical land, 'C' (capital) means 'control key' and 'M' (capital) means 'meta' which means 'Alt key'.
if you accidentally backspace twice, you'll find yourself in the help menu.  escape via 'q'.
save your work via C-x C-s
leave the editor via C-x C-c
gl;hf!
